# IDontNeedHelp

A [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader) mod for [Resonite](https://resonite.com/) that removes the Help tab from the RadiantDash UI.

This mod prevents the Help tab from being added to the RadiantDash interface and hides it if it was already added. It ensures a cleaner and less cluttered user interface for experienced users who don't need the Help tab.


## Installation
1. Install [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader).
2. Place [IDontNeedHelp.dll](https://github.com/nalathethird/Fck-HelpSection/releases/latest/download/IDontNeedHelp.dll) into your `rml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Resonite\rml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with ResoniteModLoader installed it will create this folder for you.
3. Start the game. If you want to verify that the mod is working you can check your Resonite logs.
